# Diabetes-Prediction
This data science project focuses on predicting diabetes diagnosis using a dataset with various health-related features. The workflow includes thorough data cleaning, transformation of categorical variables, exploratory data analysis, and the implementation of three different classifiers.

## Project Overview:

1. Data Collection:
   - The project utilizes a Kaggle dataset readily available for use, streamlining the data acquisition process.

2. Data Analysis:
   - Initial dataset analysis involves extracting relevant insights and applying statistical approaches to glean valuable information.

3. Data Cleaning:
   - The data is meticulously cleaned using pandas, with a focus on transforming categorical data into numerical formats for further analysis.

4. Model Selection:
   - Logistic Regression serves as the initial model, with training performed using the scikit-learn library. Additionally, a variant of Logistic Regression employing MinMaxScaler is created. Despite achieving high accuracy and precision, further models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine are explored. A VotingClassifier is employed, and a comprehensive evaluation is conducted, with the superior VotingClassifier being chosen.

5. Data Visualization:
   - Visualization of key insights is executed using matplotlib and seaborn libraries, enhancing the interpretability of the findings.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, the project successfully employs a diverse set of models and techniques for diabetes prediction. The chosen VotingClassifier model demonstrates superior performance, offering a robust solution with high predictive accuracy. The project's findings are complemented by visualizations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the dataset. This predictive model holds promise for practical applications and thorough evaluations.
